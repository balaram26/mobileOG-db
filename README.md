## Description of the mobileOGs database
The mobileOGs database is a manually curated database of protein families mediating the integration/excision, replication/recombination/repair, stability/defense, or transfer of bacterial mobile genetic elements and phages as well as their associated transcriptional regulators. There are also a large selection of phage structural genes and genes mediating lysis and lysogeny.
